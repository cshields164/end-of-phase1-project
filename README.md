# end-of-phase1-project

Project Intro/Objective

For this project, the team and I are analyzing a dataset attempting to predict student performance in secondary education. For this data approach we split our data analysis into five different analysis approaches:

1. Students education in comparison to time spent on activites as well as leisure. 

2. Compare student performance with the parents alcohol use during workdays and weekends.

3. Compare students grades in relation to the parents education as well as profession. 

4. Compare students travel time in correlation to performance.

5. Compare internet access in correlation to student performance. 

6. Compare romantic relationships in correlation to student performance. 

I compared student grades in relation to the parents education level and profession. To see if there's a correlation between the three. Focusing on Parents Education, Profession and Student grades.  

Methods Used:

Inferential Statistics
Machine Learning
Data Visualization
Predictive Modeling
Linear Regression
Technologies
Python
Pandas, jupyter
Numpy, Matplotlib
Seaborn, Sklearn


Project Description
The project entails using data visualization models and linear regression models.

We first have to explore the data of what is given to us to understand what it is about, the story it is telling us and what we are trying to gain from the data. Then we have to clean the data because there is a lot of irrelevent information and missing data that we need to come up with a solution to the problem we have at hand. Finally, we have to apply what we learned from the data with some statistical models to prove or disprove the null hypothesis that student performance is not affected by parents education level and professions. Our alternative hypothesis being made is that there is a direct correlation between Parental education, Parental profession, and student performance.

We used histograms, boxplots to give us a visualization of the data. We then use pandas technologies to manipulate the data to make sure it is free from irrelevant information and things that are not needed to come up with a more clean and sleek dataset. Finally, we just used Linear Regression to train the data and give us predictions to give us the mean square and R of the data set only analyzing 7 columns: Mothers job, mothers education, fathers job, fathers education, and the three grade values (G1, G2, G3) for the students.
